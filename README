# Overview

I built a small Java command-line **Pomodoro timer** called **FocusTimer** to learn core Java while creating something I can actually use. It runs in the terminal and alternates between focus and break sessions for a set number of cycles. The app shows the current phase, cycle number, and time remaining, supports **pause/resume** (`p` + Enter) and **quit** (`q` + Enter), handles Ctrl-C cleanly, and writes a simple CSV row at the end of each run so I can track what I finished.

My goal was to practice everyday Java: simple argument parsing, a clear class layout, a tiny state machine, time calculations with `java.time`, and a scheduled loop that avoids drift. I kept the code straightforward and readable so itâ€™s easy to extend later.
